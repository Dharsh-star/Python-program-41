Write a python program to find the most frequent words from a file.

Coding:

name = input('Enter file:')
handle = open(name, 'r')
text = handle.read()
words = text.split()
counts = dict()
for word in words:
counts[word] = counts.get(word,0) + 1
bigcount = None
bigword = None
for word,count in counts.items():
if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
bigword = word
bigcount = count
print(bigword, bigcount)

Enter file: sample.txt
